## Steps to get started
1. Add a `.env.local` file with the following variable: `MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://kogreni:todo12345678!@todocluster.k2fg0of.mongodb.net/todo_db` (if you wish to run the app locally)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app

### Description
To check out the app deployed in Vercel: https://todo-app-omega-eight-80.vercel.app/ (also available in the repository).
This is a simple app using Next.js and MongoDB to add/update/display/delete your tasks for the day (CRUD operations). It employs a pretty simple and straightforward UI.
Once you run the app, some tasks may already be displayed as I have populated the database beforehand to show that it saves results in the database properly.
