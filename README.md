### Description
This is a simple app using Next.js and MongoDB to add/update/display/delete your tasks for the day (CRUD operations). It employs a pretty simple and straightforward UI.
Once you run the app, some tasks may already be displayed as I have populated the database beforehand to show that it saves results in the database properly.
